   There's no wrong answer to the question of how you get your work done. Some answers are better than others,
   and Emacs is obviously the best answer. But there are no /wrong/ answers.
** Things I like about Emacs
*** Emacs Lisp
    VimL/VimScript is an abomination against nature. Emacs Lisp is the best configuration-as-code option out there.
    Plus, it's Lisp, which is awesome.
*** Magit
    No editor does a better Git integration than Emacs. And that's thanks to Magit. If you install Spacemacs, make
    sure you install the git layer. Use =SPC g s= in a project to start.
*** Dired
    The command line is inefficient. Dired lets you treat directories as buffers and perform operations on file,
    subdirectories, etc. Jump to a directory with =SPC f j=.
*** ALL THE THINGS!
    There are way too many great things about Emacs to list.
** Things I like about Vim
*** Normal mode
    If Vim only does one thing right, it's modal editing. Seriously, there's nothing quite as powerful as normal
    mode when it comes to editing text.
*** Ex commands
    For quick, simple edits made throughout an entire file, Vim's ex commands are handy. Like adding text to the
    beginning of every line:

    =:%s/^/Hello/g=

    Ex commands in Spacemacs are great because you can run anonymous Lisp functions in them:

    =:(message "Hello!")=
** Spacemacs
   It's the best of both worlds. Vim inside Emacs, for real. This is *NOT* like Vim emulation in Visual Studio
   or some other affront to all sensibility.
*** Vim in normal mode
    Spacemacs gives us modal editing in Emacs! You get all the mnemonic shortcuts Vim users are used to.

    Copy everything inside a single quotation marks (inclusive) with =y a '=.

    Delete everything inside parentheses (exclusive) with =d i )=. This is super useful for writing Lisp.

    Jump to insert mode with =i=. And a whole lot more!
*** Emacs in insert mode
    Spacemacs gives us Emacs keybindings in insert mode. I don't always want to jump out to normal mode to make a
    single change. Using =M-d= to delete forward or =M-u= to upcase to word end is great. (=M-u= stands for =ALT+u=).
*** Vim like mnemonics tied to SPC
    Because Spacemacs is just Emacs under the hood, it has access to an endless number of functions and packages. Many
    of these are accessible to Spacemacs users via the =SPC= bar. Commands use a Vim-like mnemonic to make keybindings
    easier to remeber.

    For example, I can =SPC D i= to view all my Docker images. Or I can =SPC f f= to find a file.
** But muh servers!
   As someone whose focus is within the realm of DevOps, access to remote servers is the most common argument
   against Emacs that I encounter. Vi is everywhere. It's a simple SSH away.

   I say if you're SSH'ing into a machine to run an editor, you're doing it wrong.
*** TRAMP
    TRAMP stands for *Transparent Remote Access Multiple Protocols* and it comes with Emacs by default. It lets
    you open remote filepaths from your local Emacs and edit them there.

    It's like the remote-edit plugin for Atom. Except it works. And is good.

    If I want to open a file on a server, I =SPC f f= and navigate to this path:

    =/ssh:user@host:/file=

    I can pipe into sudo for root access to the file too:

    =/ssh:user@host|sudo:/file=

    And it works for Docker containers:

    =/docker:user@container:/file=

    TRAMP will use your =~/.ssh/config= file or prompt you for a password.
