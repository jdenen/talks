Presentations and the code that supports them.
** Write in org-mode
   Use [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]] to develop a presentation.
** Export HTML
   Inside a presentation org file, use =C-c C-e R R= to export to HTML.
** Build and run server
   Use =docker-compose= to build the presentation image and spin up a container. The command 
   requires a =presentation= environment variable set to the HTML file you want to serve.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     presentation=what_is_ci.html docker-compose up -d --build
   #+END_SRC
** Talk
   Visit =localhost:8000= to give the presentation. Use =s= to display the speaker notes page.
